Description: Crop breeding programs interested in using genetic resources often have difficulty identifying useful accessions from germplasm collections.
  To efficiently use the diversity present in large germplasm collections, breeders often identify a subset of accessions that represent the larger collection.
  This package provides functions to aid breeders in identifying and evaluating subsets using different methods.
